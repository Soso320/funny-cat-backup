I never thought that my obsession with Himiko Toga would go this far. It has gone so far that I'm loosing friends over it. I also get harrased a lot because of my waifu. But at the same time Toga brings me a lot of happiness. I am a lot happier ever day with Toga. I am an introvert so it is really hard for me to make new friends, and I can't just make new friends who will accept me. I have asked my "friends" what I had to do to have them like me again, and they said I have to stop liking Toga. I really don't want to drop Toga, but at the same time I want at least one good friend. What should I do? Should I keep my waifu or my friends. Also I know that one of those friends sometimes reads my posts, so if you are reading this don't feel bad. I want you to do what you want and not have to worry about me. **[Courtesy of jaco#1738]**
